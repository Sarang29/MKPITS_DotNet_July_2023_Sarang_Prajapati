	<h3> Java </h3>
	
	<p> Java is great programming language invented by James Gosling and others in 1994 for the development of enterprise 
	grade applications. This programming Language is evolved from a language named Oak. Oak was developed in the early 
	nineties at Sun Microsystems as a platform-independent language aimed at allowing entertainment appliances such as 
	video game consoles and VCRs to communicate.The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer 
	low-level facilities than either of them. It is the underlying technology that powers state-of-the-art programs 
	including utilities, games, and business applications. Java runs on more than 850 million personal computers worldwide, 
	and on billions of devices worldwide, including mobile and TV devices.

	<ul> 
	<li> Java<br> Java is great programming language invented by James Gosling and others in 1994 for the development of 
	enterprise grade applications. This programming Language is evolved from a language named Oak. Oak was developed in the 
	early nineties at Sun Microsystems as a platform-independent language aimed at allowing entertainment appliances such as 
	video game consoles and VCRs to communicate.The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer 
	low-level facilities than either of them. It is the underlying technology that powers state-of-the-art programs including 
	utilities, games, and business applications. Java runs on more than 850 million personal computers worldwide, and on 
	billions of devices worldwide, including mobile and TV devices. </li><br>
	
	<li> Dotnet <br> .NET Core is the latest general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft. It works across 
	different platforms and has been redesigned in a way that makes .NET fast, flexible and modern. .NET Core happens to be 
	one of the major contributions by Microsoft. Developers can now build Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, and Windows applications 
	with .NET, all in Open Source.<br>

ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites. 
It allows you to use a full featured programming language such as C# or VB.NET to build web applications easily.</li>

	<li> PHP <br> PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful 
	it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.<br>

PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.
PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.
PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
PHP Syntax is C-Like.

<h2> Java </h2>
<p>Java is great programming language invented by James Gosling and others in 1994 for the development of enterprise grade 
applications. This programming Language is evolved from a language named Oak. Oak was developed in the early nineties at Sun 
Microsystems as a platform-independent language aimed at allowing entertainment appliances such as video game consoles and 
VCRs to communicate.The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either 
of them. It is the underlying technology that powers state-of-the-art programs including utilities, games, and business 
applications. Java runs on more than 850 million personal computers worldwide, and on billions of devices worldwide, including 
mobile and TV devices.

once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.</li>
<li>PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed 
object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.</li>
